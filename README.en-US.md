NAI Launcher is a third-party client for NovelAI built with Flutter. It integrates image generation, image-to-image, inpainting, Vibe / Precise Reference, local gallery, online gallery, generation queues, Krita integration, and statistical tools into a single desktop application, making it ideal for daily generation, batch processing, and long-term management of local artwork.

Also includes NAI/SD weight syntax assistance, token counting, in-box prompt search, and pinned words. |
| 📚 Local Gallery | Supports recursive scanning, SQLite full-text search, categories/collections/favorites, metadata parsing, batch operations, and large image previews. |
| 🌐 Online Gallery | Supports Danbooru / Safebooru / Gelbooru / AI TAG search, native rankings, multi-image details, metadata reuse, and batch downloads. |
| 📦 Generation Queue | Supports task sorting, batch generation, pause/resume, failure handling strategies, progress statistics, and queue import/export. |
| 🔌 External Integration | Supports local Krita integration, local ComfyUI workflows, system proxy, cross-platform image copying, and file location. |

### Online Gallery Sources

- **Danbooru / Safebooru**: Support tag and date searches plus native daily, weekly, and monthly rankings for a selected date. Danbooru supports login and writable favorites; Safebooru uses anonymous, read-only access to `safebooru.donmai.us`.
- **Gelbooru**: Supports public search. Optional API credentials accelerate searches and enable read-only website favorites; no synthetic local ranking is presented.
- **AI TAG**: Supports combined work/author/title/tag/model queries and verbatim Prompt syntax searches such as `::artist:`, with time ranges loaded from the live source configuration. Native live monthly, historical monthly, and older archives are available. Multi-image details support navigation, prefetching, and per-image NAI / Stable Diffusion / ComfyUI metadata reuse, plus current-image and whole-work downloads. AI TAG requires no account and is read-only.

## 🧩 Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | Available | Primary development and release platform. Supports system tray, window state persistence, video playback, clipboard, and file location. |
| macOS | Minimal Support | Supports building, launching, login, local database, video playback, Keychain, system proxy, image copying, and file location. System tray support to be added later. |
| Linux | Unreleased | Desktop code branches exist, but official packages are not currently provided. |
| Android | Planned | Still in the adaptation/planning phase. |

## 📦 Download & Install

Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/Aaalice233/Aaalice_NAI_Launcher/releases). The app persistently surfaces available updates before and after login and fully renders GitHub Flavored Markdown release notes, including headings, lists, tables, quotes, code, links, and images.

| Platform | Download File | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | `NAI_Launcher_Windows_<version>_Setup.exe` | Installer version, recommended for general users. Supports resumable in-app downloads, verification, automatic installation, and restart. Manual setup also detects and closes an older version still running in the tray. |
| Windows | `NAI_Launcher_Windows_<version>_Portable.zip` | Portable version. In-app updates stage the new version, preserve user files, atomically swap directories, and automatically roll back and restart the previous version on failure. |
| macOS | `NAI_Launcher_macOS_<version>_Portable.zip` | Portable version. Extract and open `Aaalice NAI Launcher.app`. If an unnotarized build is blocked, you can allow it to open in System Settings > Privacy & Security. |

You can log in for the first time using your NovelAI account credentials or an API Token. Account data is stored locally on the device only. The desktop app uses the system's secure storage for sensitive information.

### Autocomplete Data & Privacy

- The base Danbooru tag and alias catalog ships with the app and is queried locally without a network connection.
- The Simplified Chinese translation dictionary is optional. It is downloaded directly from the [ffdkj/ComfyUI_Danbooru_Tag_Assistant](https://github.com/ffdkj/ComfyUI_Danbooru_Tag_Assistant) upstream only after user confirmation; this project does not redistribute that database.
- The Danbooru online supplement is enabled by default. It sends only the current English token under the cursor, never the complete prompt; it can be disabled and its cache cleared separately under Settings → Data Sources & Cache.
- AI translation for missing entries is disabled by default. When enabled, it reuses the Prompt Assistant `Translate` route and sends at most 8 untranslated tags to the model service selected by the user, which may incur API charges. Its cache can be cleared separately.

## 🛠️ Build from Source

### Environment Requirements

- Flutter `3.44.2` (project minimum requirement is Flutter `3.35.0` / Dart `3.10.7`)
- Git LFS, required for pulling `assets/databases/*.db`
- Windows Build: Visual Studio 2022 with Desktop development with C++
- Windows Build: [NuGet CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/install-nuget-client-tools), the directory containing `nuget.exe` must be added to `PATH`
- macOS Build: Full Xcode, CocoaPods, Git LFS

### General Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aaalice233/Aaalice_NAI_Launcher.git
cd Aaalice_NAI_Launcher

git lfs install
git lfs pull --include="assets/databases/*.db"

flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

### Windows

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify_nuget.ps1
flutter build windows --release
```

The Windows implementation of `flutter_inappwebview` fetches native dependencies like the WebView2 SDK via NuGet during compilation. If `verify_nuget.ps1` fails, please install the NuGet CLI first and ensure `nuget help` runs directly in a new PowerShell window.

Output directory:

```text
build/windows/x64/runner/Release/
```

For Windows desktop development, start a dedicated hot-reload session:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/dev_hot_reload_window.ps1
```

After editing code, safely trigger that existing session from any terminal without starting a second `flutter attach`:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/trigger_hot_reload.ps1
# To reset application state:
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/trigger_hot_reload.ps1 -Restart
```

To inspect the real desktop window, capture it directly into the project temp directory. Direct rendering also works when the window is covered:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/capture_dev_window.ps1
# Custom output path or capture without activating the window:
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/capture_dev_window.ps1 -OutputPath tool/.tmp/ui.png -NoActivate
```

### macOS

```bash
flutter build macos --release
```

Output path:

```text
build/macos/Build/Products/Release/Aaalice NAI Launcher.app
```

During local development, if the Keychain repeatedly prompts for authorization, you can first create a stable local signing certificate and then run the signed launch script:

```bash
scripts/create_macos_dev_cert.sh
scripts/dev_run_macos_signed.sh debug
```

## 🚀 Release Process

Releases are handled by the `Release` workflow in GitHub Actions. After pushing a `v*` tag, the workflow builds the Windows installer, Windows portable, and macOS portable versions, then generates `release_manifest.json`, `checksums.txt`, and Release notes. The Release page groups direct Setup / Portable download badges by operating system and includes platform icons.

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin main
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Before releasing, please ensure:

- The version number in `pubspec.yaml` has been updated; the tag must match the version without the `+build` suffix, e.g., `1.0.0+17` corresponds to `v1.0.0`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` has been updated under `✨ Added`, `🛠 Improved`, and `🐛 Fixed`; do not add a release-file table because the release script generates it automatically.
- `assets/databases/tag_catalog.db` and `assets/databases/cooccurrence.db` are actual SQLite files rather than Git LFS pointers and pass `dart run tool/tag_catalog/verify_bundled_databases.dart`.
- The Windows installer depends on NSIS; for local packaging, you can run `pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/package_windows_release.ps1`.
- For Authenticode signing, configure the GitHub Secrets `WINDOWS_SIGNING_CERT_BASE64` (Base64-encoded PFX) and `WINDOWS_SIGNING_CERT_PASSWORD`. The workflow signs the portable executable before packaging, signs the installer afterward, and requires `signtool verify` to pass. Builds remain unsigned when no certificate is configured.
- Use `scripts/sign_windows_binary.ps1` for local signing, for example: `pwsh -File scripts/sign_windows_binary.ps1 -Path dist/setup.exe -CertificatePath cert.pfx -CertificatePassword '<password>'`.
