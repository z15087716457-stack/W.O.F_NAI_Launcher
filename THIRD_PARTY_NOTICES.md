## Danbooru/e621 Tag Data

The bundled `assets/databases/tag_catalog.db` is generated from the complete
`danbooru_e621_merged.csv` snapshot distributed by
[ComfyUI-Lora-Manager](https://github.com/willmiao/ComfyUI-Lora-Manager).
The tag data originates from
[DraconicDragon/dbr-e621-lists-archive](https://github.com/DraconicDragon/dbr-e621-lists-archive).
Both Danbooru categories `0`, `1`, `3`, `4`, and `5` and e621 categories `7`
through `12`, `14`, and `15` are imported. The source snapshot, URL, SHA256,
expected record counts, and included category set are locked in
`tool/tag_catalog/source_lock.json`.

The source data is dedicated to the public domain under the Unlicense:

> This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.
> Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute

ComfyUI-Lora-Manager is GPL-3.0 licensed. Only its pinned copy of the
Unlicense tag dataset is used here; no Python, JavaScript, or other GPL
implementation code from that project is included in this application.

## Danbooru Co-occurrence Data

The bundled `assets/databases/cooccurrence.db` is generated only from
`danbooru_tags_cooccurrence.csv` in the
[newtextdoc1111/danbooru-tag-csv](https://huggingface.co/datasets/newtextdoc1111/danbooru-tag-csv)
dataset. The upstream README declares the dataset under the MIT License. The
pinned revision, source URL, SHA256, output hash, and record count are recorded
in `tool/database/cooccurrence_source_lock.json`. The dataset's separate base
tag CSV is not used by this application.

## Optional ffdkj Chinese Dictionary

The optional `tag.sqlite` Chinese dictionary is not bundled or redistributed.
After explicit user confirmation, the application downloads it directly from
[ffdkj/ComfyUI_Danbooru_Tag_Assistant](https://github.com/ffdkj/ComfyUI_Danbooru_Tag_Assistant).
That upstream repository did not declare a license when this integration was
implemented.

## Pica

This project contains a pure Dart port of the Lanczos3 resize pipeline from
[Pica](https://github.com/nodeca/pica).

## PromptCard-Studio (algorithm reference)

The style-exploration deep-iteration mutation engine
(`lib/core/utils/explore_mutation_engine.dart`) is a pure Dart
reimplementation whose *algorithm design* is inspired by
[monineko/PromptCard-Studio](https://github.com/monineko/PromptCard-Studio)
(`backend/app/style_explore_algorithm.py`, `generate_deep_candidates`).
PromptCard-Studio is licensed under GPL-3.0. No source code from that
project is copied into this application; the Dart implementation follows
the same high-level semantics (per-parent fairness guarantee, random
injection quota, weighted-parent crossover, dedup attempts) with
intentional, documented deviations for this app's prompt-block model.
